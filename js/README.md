# Lidy

_The YAML-YAML type-oriented schema validation tool_

Think JSON Schema but for YAML. Please have a look at the [main README file](https://github.com/mathieucaroff/lidy). You may also want to have a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/mathieucaroff/lidy/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md) for the Lidy language.
